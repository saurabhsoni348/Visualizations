## Introduction
In this notebook, we revise our knowledge of graph types by exploring various categories, understanding their characteristics, and identifying appropriate use cases. Each graph type is demonstrated with a code example.

## Graph Types

### Line Graph
A line graph is used to display trends over time.

### Bar Graph
A bar graph is useful for comparing different categories.

### Histogram
A histogram is used to show the distribution of a dataset.

### Scatter Plot
A scatter plot helps identify relationships between two variables.

### Box Plot
A box plot shows the spread and skewness of the data.

### Pie Chart
A pie chart displays proportions of a whole.

### Heatmap
A heatmap is used for showing data density and patterns.
